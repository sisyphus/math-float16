# Module Math::Float16 #
########################

Currently, this module builds only on 64-bit builds of perl. This might
be fixedin the future but, for now, the build aborts (with the
appropriate explanation) if one tries to build it on a 32-bit perl.

To build this module you need to have a perl that is at version 5.32 or
later, and that has been built by a compiler that supports the  _Float16 type.

You additionally need to have installed Math-MPFR-4.43 or later, and also
version 4.3.0 (or later) of the mpfr C library (https://www.mpfr.org).
A further requirement is that Math::MPFR was built against version 4.3.0
(or later) of the mpfr library.
Note that the mpfr library depends upon the gmp library from
https://gmplib.org, so gmp also needs to be installed.

At time of writing (22.07.25) the latest stable version of mpfr is 4.2.2.
Until 4.3.0 is released, the mpfr library therefore needs to be built from
mpfr's current gitlab repo at https://gitlab.inria.fr/mpfr/mpfr, where the
version that resides there calls itself 4.3.0-dev.

The Makefile.PL checks that all of these requirements are met, and aborts
with the appropriate explanation when they are not.
